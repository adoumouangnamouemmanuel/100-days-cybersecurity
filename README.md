# 100 Days of Cybersecurity & C++ Programming

Welcome to the **100 Days of Cybersecurity & C++ Programming** challenge repository! This project is designed to take you through a comprehensive journey in both C++ programming and cybersecurity. By the end of this 100-day challenge, you will have a solid foundation in both fields, along with practical skills and hands-on projects.

## Introduction

This challenge is split into **3 phases**:

1. **Phase 1**: Foundations of C++ programming and Cybersecurity (Day 1-30)
2. **Phase 2**: Intermediate concepts and tools (Day 31-60)
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced topics, Real-world applications, and Capstone projects (Day 61-100)

The goal is to help you master both areas through detailed exercises, mini-projects, and real-world applications.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundations (Day 1-30)
- **Introduction to C++ and basic syntax**
- **Cybersecurity fundamentals**: Encryption, hashing, and basic cryptography
- **File handling and user input/output**

### Phase 2: Intermediate Concepts (Day 31-60)
- **Data structures and algorithms in C++**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts**
- **Building secure applications and ethical hacking techniques**

### Phase 3: Advanced Concepts (Day 61-100)
- **Advanced C++ programming concepts**
- **Web security, network security, and penetration testing**
- **Capstone projects**: Building your own security tools, creating real-world C++ projects

## Projects

Throughout this challenge, you will work on several projects that will help you apply what you have learned. Some key projects include:

- **Shell Implementation**: Build your own command-line shell in C++.
- **Simple Encryption Tools**: Implement basic encryption algorithms.
- **Penetration Testing Toolkit**: Build tools that simulate real-world penetration tests.
- **Cybersecurity Logger**: A tool to monitor and analyze log files for potential threats.
- **Networking Projects**: Secure communication apps and basic network sniffers.
